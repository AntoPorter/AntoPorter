    Hello, World! 🌍
    I'm [@AntoPorter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyantoporter/), your friendly neighborhood Cloud Security Architect.
    When I'm not busy wrestling with cyber threats, you can find me:
    - Crafting secure solutions with Microsoft Intune and Defender XDR 🛡️
    - Navigating the clouds of Azure ☁️
    - Building fortresses that even the most cunning hackers can't breach 🏰

    Fun Fact: My PowerShell scripts have been known to cause confusion and improve productivity. Use with caution! 😄

    Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or just say hi!
